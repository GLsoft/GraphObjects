// bits 0-3 string tag
// bits 4-7 length in bytes (NOT NULL terminated, if the string exceeds 7 bytes set to 0xff and
//   and length will be determined by length of descriptor
// bits 8+ NON-NULL terminated string

// This encoding has the benefit that strings less than 7 bytes can fit inside a tagged pointer,
// but are also valid in a memory buffer. That means we can use the same code path for them by
// using LGGOTaggedMemoryDescriptor, which wraps an address and presents it as a memory buffer.
